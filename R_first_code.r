#  This is my first code in github! QUite exciting, right?

# Here are the input data
# Costanza data on streams
water <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
water

# Marta data on fishes genomes
fishes <- c(10, 50, 60, 100, 200)

# a funtcion is used with arguments inside!

# a table in R is called data frame
